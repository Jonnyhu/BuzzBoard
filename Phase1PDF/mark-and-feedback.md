# Feedback

* It doesn't look like there was much effort put into introducing the team. (-2 points from Introducing the team section)
* The personas are well done but some of the text is cutoff. 
* Your user stories are great, but the format is incorrect and they need to be split up. Each paragraph is actually 3-4 user stories. The format is: "As a *user*, I want *something*, so that I get *benefit*.  Ask me if you have questions. (-4 points from User stories section)
* You're on the right track with your MVP, but remember you are pitching to a non-technical audience. Having a list of features is unappealing and hard to understand. Describe your product, and talk about its "cool" features. (-3 points from MVP section)
* R & I planning is clear, but your decision to exclude several user stories should be clarified further. (-1 point from R & I planning section)
* Great CRC cards, and logical scenarios. 
* Please contact me to set up a meeting if you wish to discuss my comments.
