#Process.md 
 - When developing our process, we had difficulty setting up our back end structures using Eclipse.
In addition, Eclipse's interface for managing repositories was causing our working copies to lose
synchronization with other group members. The alternative we used was NetBeans.

 - NetBeans worked well for our team in solving the above issue due to its integration with the GitHub interface.
Under the top navigation bar, there existed a team menu that easily let us connect to our GitHub repository.
Once the project is cloned to make a local copy, we were able to right click our project and issue git commands
from a select list. This and the GitHub webpage allowed us to ensure our code reached other group members.

 - The GitHub webpage was utilized for Code review when merging from branches or checking commits for errors.
Viewing the changes made to files made clear to everyone what was added, modifed and deleted. In some cases, we would
point out bugs found in other members code with the blame feature and notify the member of the potential problem before
it was deployed. We found that sending issues through GitHub to other group members did not work out as planned. Most
of the time the issues were left unchecked or never closed, yet the problems mentioned were handled.

 - Meetings, whether in person or through Skype, were the key tools/techniques we used to manage our product.
 Skype meetings were used to broadcast our progress to other members, schedule times where we could meet in person or
 ask simple questions regarding the direction of our assigned tasks. In person we collaboratively worked on integrating our separate pieces of code with the master branch, wrote up reports and continued working on our sections if any features were not yet finalized.  
 
- If we continued working as a team, labeling and improving issues on GitHub could have been useful had we followed
the system better. The ideal process would be similar to our current working process, but with better organization in
scheduling meeting times and issue management.
