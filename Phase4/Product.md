Our project is an online communication platform for students called BuzzBoard.
While creating it we kept in mind all the things that are important to students even those things that they may not realize at first. We made it in such way that it is simple, stylish, distractions free, cross platform with iOS and Android apps, on the top of website, and truly connecting.

We understand how hard it is to keep focused on things that matter. That is why we have real-time SMS notification system so that students only pay attention to something that is relevant.

We have made an advanced subscription model to let students to decide what is relevant to them instead of someone else to decide that. They can decide what to follow - a discussion/topic or a person and receive updates on their chosen source via SMS. If a student choses not to follow someone or some topic her/she can usubscribe at any given time.

We actually want to minimize the time a student spends on our website. We only require from students essential information such as their name, email and phone number for notifications and password recovery. No profile pictures, photo albums, interests, friendships, nothing that will make you want to do things that you should not be doing.
Our website specializes in delivering information and nothing else. The content you may want to post or subscribe can be anything: a quick notification to your project group, a quick sale or donation of unneeded item, a topic discussion, a professor trying to give an update to the class or any local campus related information.
