# Individual Reports

-----

## Name (GitHub username)

Here is an example of a fake report, just to give you an idea of the format we are expecting.
We would like you to be concise yet informative.

 * My most significant contrubution was the design and implementation of Component X (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * While working on our Android app (and then later in class), I learned about adapters (links to relevant and interesting source-files/commits/issues).
 * I am always helping my teammates - I am the most experienced coder on the team, and I helped other teammates set up their development environment, and get up to speed with the tools we've used (give examples of specific tools).
 * I could keep people more informed of what I am doing - I made a few large commits that conflicted with everybody else's code, and merging everything wasted a lot of our time.

## Jiale/Jonny (Jonnyhu)

 * My most significant contribution was the design and implementation of the Relational Database that stores all our data for Buzzboard, the Data Access Objects (DAO) that all of our object controller uses to communicate with the database, also the deployment and hosting of the Buzzboard web application on Amazon Web Services.
 * While working on our Web app (and then later in class), I learned about Data Access Objects, how the front end and the back end of a Web application communicate. I am now more comfortable with designing object oriented web application, and how to divide up the project into phases that will generate steady progress.
 * I am always helping my teammates - I am more experience in writing SQL queries, I was able to solve data missmatch problem by writing good query that handles the problem on server side. (For example, I was able to get a list of topic from all user that the current user is subscribed to given only the username. I solved this problem by writing one query that executes on the database, instead of many queries to find the useID first, then list the subscribed user and then list all topic from those users.)
 * I sometimes mismanage my time, and will miss the first half of the team meeting. Thankfully my team members keep me upto date with skype message and gitHub features. I also need to document changes I make, it is hard to remember the reason a feature is implemented this way after a week of down time.

## Alex (AlexandreStrain)

 * My significant contribution towards the project was the design and implementation of the login and most of the features on the profile (such as editing and layout). I was in charge of generating the controllers, html pages for these features, which connected to the implementations of Jonny's DAOs and the database. I also started work on the making the html layout for the forgot password feature, the rest was handled by Anton. (Example: https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-UTM-Team2-repo/commit/4abf8701ce3f96add69a6d9b647a0c069a3ad3c7)
 * I learned a lot about how to use Data Access Objects, creating better cohesive code and the structure of web pages. By going through processes like scrum and kanban I learned how to better manage my time on completing tasks.
 * My additon of CCT greatly aided in bringing some useful user-oriented design to our code. For example to better communicate to the user I created error messages upon login, profile updating and forgot password verification. (https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-UTM-Team2-repo/commits/master, search for commits on NOV 21). I was also able to assist my team with discovering bugs or visiblity problems when communicating our code to the user.
 * I should learn how to better proofread my own work. Many times, I would run across an unintentional bug or inefficient code that other group members would find, which was simple to fix but I couldn't see right away. I also needed to spend a little more time to better understand the structure of communicating between features and the database.

## Anton (csc301ab)

What is your most significant individual contribution?

My most significant contribution was adding SMS service to our project so that users would be getting SMS notifications based on their subscription to other users and topics.

Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.

I learned about ORM - object-relational mapping which allows to treat database records as objects that mapped to classes instead of simple strings.

What is your main strength(s) as a team member?

I am able to work on many things simultaneously and deliver on time. I often gave code suggestions and made sure our team followed the right design patterns from the beggining (such as naming conventions, class decoupling, design patterns etc.).

What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

Sometimes working in a team environment (when we all sit together) is not for me as I get distracted and then can easily lose focus and remain unproductive for quite a while. Maybe, I should distance myself from my team when I am working on features that have many testcases that have to be caught.

## Vlad (GitHub vf0)


 * My most significant contrubution was adding form submissions such as posting new topics and posting new replies. 
 * I learned more about Java development and how to use the Spring.io. It was good to learn to write and use data access objects and controllers.
 * I work well during scrum meetings when the group is in the same room. I find it easy to debug issues and fix bugs.
 * I found it hard to work over Skype, so I was probably no help during Skype meetings.
